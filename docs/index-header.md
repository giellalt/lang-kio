This page documents the work on the **Kiowa language model**. 

The model contains a handful of nouns, as well as the number suffix,
and a dummy verb and suffixes + flag diacritics for governing them.

The analyser is thus in an experimental stage, and cannot be used to anything.

For Kiowa, we have also been working on a keyboard layout.
